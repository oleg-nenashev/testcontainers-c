# Testcontainers for C/C++. Roadmap 

A full public roadmap is coming soon.
See the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-c/issues) and,
in particular,
the pinned issues to learn about the key initiatives on the table.

## Key Objectives

- Ensure sufficient feature parity with Testcontainers for Go ([#6](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-c/issues/6))
- Add a C++ binding library and class-based headers ([#12](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-c/issues/12))
- Prototype and document support for other languages that
  leverage native libraries, in particular Swift
- Make Testcontainers for C/C++ an official project
  listed on the [Testcontainers site](https://testcontainers.com/)
- Publish the project to common C/C++ package managers
  ([vcpkg](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-c/issues/2),
  [Conan](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-c/issues/3))
